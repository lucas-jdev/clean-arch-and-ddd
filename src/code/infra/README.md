# About Infrastructure

The infrastructure layer is the outermost layer of the Clean Architecture and is responsible for providing the necessary infrastructure to the application. It is in this layer that the application interacts with external systems, such as databases, web services, and so on.

## Frameworks

Frameworks are the tools used to implement the infrastructure layer. They are responsible for providing the necessary infrastructure to the application, such as databases, web services, and so on.

Frameworks are important within the infrastructure layer because they allow the application to interact with external systems, such as databases, web services, and so on. They also allow the application to be implemented using different technologies, such as Java, .NET, and so on.

Examples of frameworks used in the infrastructure layer are:

* [Quarkus](/src/code/infra/framework/quarkus/README.md)
* [Spring](/src/code/infra/framework/spring/README.md)

## REST

REST is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. RESTful web services allow requests to be made using a uniform and predefined set of rules.

## GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.


## Database

A database is a collection of data stored in a computer system. It is a structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways.
